            Like many businesses, we also collect information through cookies and

              automatically collect when you access or use our Website and which we
              record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log
              data may include your IP address, device information, browser type and
              settings and information about your activity in the Website (such as
              the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files
              viewed, searches and other actions you take such as which features you

            </li>
            <li>

              application identification numbers, location, browser type, hardware
              model Internet service provider and/or mobile carrier, operating
              system and system configuration information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <i>Location Data.</i> We collect location data such as information
              about your device&#39;s location, which can be either precise or
              imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and
              settings of the device you use to access the Website. For example, we
              may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that
              tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt
              out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing
              access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on
              your device. Note however, if you choose to opt out, you may not be
              able to use certain aspects of the Services.
