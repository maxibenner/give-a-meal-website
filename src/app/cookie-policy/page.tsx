          <h5>What are cookies?</h5>
          <p className="body">
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
            mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
            website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
            efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
          </p>
          <p className="body">
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Fotura, Inc.) are
            called &quot;first party cookies&quot;. Cookies set by parties other
            than the website owner are called &quot;third party cookies&quot;.
            Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be
            provided on or through the website (e.g. like advertising, interactive
            content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies
            can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
            question and also when it visits certain other websites.
          </p>
          <h5>Why do we use cookies?</h5>
          <p className="body">
            We use first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
            are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to
            operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or
            &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us
            to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
            experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
            through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other purposes.
            This is described in more detail below.
          </p>
          <p className="body">
            The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
            Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please
            note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the
            specific Online Properties you visit):

          <h5>How can I control cookies?</h5>
          <p className="body">
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You
            can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the
            Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to
            select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential
            cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
            you with services.
          </p>
          <p className="body">
            The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and
            on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
            website though your access to some functionality and areas of our
            website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser
            controls to accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can
            refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
            browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser&#39;s help menu for
            more information.

          <h5>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h5>
          <p className="body">
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
            website. We may use other, similar technologies from time to time,
            like web beacons (sometimes called &quot;tracking pixels&quot; or
            &quot;clear gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
            unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited
            our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for
            example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within
            a website to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to
            understand whether you have come to the website from an online
            advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve site
            performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.
            In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to
            function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
            functioning.
